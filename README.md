# Image-segmentation

In this project we download and preprocess image files from the data collection SENTINEL2_L2A
using sentinelhub.

## Import images
Be sure you already requested your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET.

After you have the credentials include them in a .env file stored in the root folder of
this project 

```commandline
# sentinelhub credentials
CLIENT_ID = "********************************"
CLIENT_SECRET = "*******************************"
```
